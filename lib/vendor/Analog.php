/**
 * A short and simple logging class for based on the idea of using closures for
 * configurability and extensibility. Functions as a static class, but you can
 * completely control the formatting and writing of log messages through closures.
 *
 * By default, this class will write to a file named /tmp/log.txt using a format
 * "machine - date - level - message\n".
 *
 * I wrote this because I wanted something simple and small like KLogger, and
 * preferably not torn out of a wider framework if possible. After searching,
 * I wasn't happy with the single-purpose libraries I found. With KLogger for
 * example, I didn't want an object instance but rather a static class, and I
 * wanted more flexibility in the back-end.
 *
 * I also found that the ones that had really flexible back-ends supported a lot
 * that I could never personally foresee needing, and could be easier to extend
 * with new back-ends that may be needed over time. Closures seem a natural fit for
 * this kind of thing.
 *
 * What about Analog, the logfile analyzer? Well, since it hasn't been updated
 * since 2004, I think it's safe to call a single-file PHP logging class the
 * same thing without it being considered stepping on toes :)
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *     <?php
 *     
 *     require_once ('Analog.php');
 *     
 *     // Default logging to /tmp/log.txt
 *     Analog::log ('Log this error', Analog::ERROR);
 *     
 *     // Create a custom object format
 *     Analog::format (function ($machine, $level, $message) {
 *       return (object) array (
 *             'machine' => $machine,
 *             'date'    => gmdate ('Y-m-d H:i:s'),
 *             'level'   => $level,
 *             'message' => $message
 *         );
 *     });
 *     
 *     // Log to a MongoDB log collection
 *     Analog::location (function ($message) {
 *         static $conn = null;
 *         if (! $conn) {
 *             $conn = new Mongo ('localhost:27017');
 *         }
 *         $conn->mydb->log->insert ($message);
 *     });
 *     
 *     // Log an error
 *     Analog::log ('The sky is falling!');
 *     
 *     // Log some debug info
 *     Analog::log ('Debugging info', Analog::DEBUG);
 *     
 *     ?>
