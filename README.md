# Elefant

[Elefant](http://www.elefantcms.com/) is a refreshingly simple PHP content management system and web framework.
Elefant is a fast, lean tool for building everything from simple websites to complete web applications.

## Built for designers

**Compiled, ultra-fast templates**

Elefant compiles your templates into secure PHP code, so rendering is as fast as possible.

**Dead simple, concise template tags**

[Familiar syntax](https://github.com/jbroadway/elefant/wiki/Templates) to other template languages, with some added conveniences for dynamic embeds and internationalization.

**Clean, easy to use site editor for your users**

Elefant comes out of the box with a [full-featured CMS](https://github.com/jbroadway/elefant/wiki/The-page-editor) for your users. You can even [white label it](https://github.com/jbroadway/elefant/wiki/White-labelling-the-CMS).

**Syntax highlighted template and CSS editor**

Sophisticated [in-browser editing](https://github.com/jbroadway/elefant/wiki/Setting-up-your-custom-designs) with highlights and references at your finger tips.

**Live preview while editing templates and CSS**

Preview in real time as you make changes. Or if you prefer, edit files directly with your editor of choice.

**Integrates with 960 grid system and jQuery**

Or any other CSS grid system, giving you complete control over your designs.

## Built for developers

**Quickly built custom apps**

With all the tools you need, and a very low learning curve, Elefant gets you writing code quickly.

**Extensively documented**

**Strong security by default**

[Flexible input validation](https://github.com/jbroadway/elefant/wiki/Forms-and-input-validation) and automatic prevention of XSS, SQL injection, CSRF, and other types of attacks.

**Very fast and low memory**

Elefant uses [less memory per request](https://github.com/jbroadway/elefant/wiki/Performance) than any of the major frameworks, so you can serve more visitors with the same resources.

**Good debugging tools**

Debug mode prints full traces with highlighted source code and variable state to help you fix bugs faster.

**Minimalist MVC/Model2 architecture**

Elefant takes a [unique but proven approach](https://github.com/jbroadway/elefant/wiki/Elefant-architecture) that helps minimize boilerplate without sacrificing code organization as your project grows.

**Shared apps to save you time**

From blogs to user management, events to search, Elefant saves you time not reinventing the wheel with [high quality shared apps](http://www.elefantcms.com/shared-apps).

**Thoroughly unit-tested**

Elefant's core framework is covered by [extensive unit tests](https://github.com/jbroadway/elefant/tree/master/tests), ensuring a stable base to build on.
